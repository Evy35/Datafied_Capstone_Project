## **EDA**
### 1. Customer Demographics Overview
   **Gender Distribution:**
The pie chart is used to reveal the distribution of customers by gender,  
- Female Distribution: 45.43%
- Male Distribution: 54.57%

This gives insights into the churn rate for each group.
- **Key Insight**: Churn rate is higher amongst the Female gender, the bank can tailor retention efforts towards the group.

**Geography Distribution:**
The bar chart displays the number of customers across different regions (France, Spain, Germany),
- France has more customers than Germany and Spain.

This gives insights into the Churn Rate by Geography: this is investigated using a donut chart

- **Key Insight**: Germany has a higher churn rate, it should be targeted with localized retention strategies.

**Age Distribution:**
The histogram shows that the age group 36–50 has the highest customer base.

### 2. Churn Patterns Analysis
**Churn by Age Group:**

The stacked bar chart shows that customers within the age bracket (36–50) have the highest churn but customers within the age bracket (51–65) have a higher churn rate.

**Churn by Credit Score:**

The scatter plot indicates that customers with credit scores below 500 have a much higher churn rate compared to those with scores above 750.
- **Key Insight**: The bank can focus on improving services or offering products to customers with lower credit scores to retain them.

### 3. Banking Behavior & Churn
**Churn by Number of Products:**

The bar chart shows that customers with only 1 product have a much higher churn than those with 2 or more products but the churn rate was higher amongst customers with 4 products.
- **Key Insight:** Investigation should be made as to why high-value customers are churning and tailored retention strategies should be offered.

**Churn by Credit Card Ownership:**

Customers with credit cards have a lower churn rate than those without.
- **Key Insight:** Offering a credit card with rewards or benefits to non-credit card holders could reduce churn.

**Churn by Active Membership:**

The bar chart reveals that inactive members have a significantly higher churn rate compared to active members.
- **Key Insight:** The bank should focus on reactivating inactive members through personalized offers or engagement programs.

## **Recommendations**
### 1. Target High-Churn Demographics
### 2. Focus on Customers with Low Credit Scores and Balances
### 3. Improve Engagement for Inactive Members
### 4. Create targeted Retention Campaigns for customers in high churn countries most especially Germany.
