# **Project Report: Customer Churn Analysis for a Canadian Bank**
## **EDA**
### 1. Customer Demographics Overview
   **Gender Distribution:**
A pie chart is used to reveal the distribution of customers by gender,  
- Female Distribution: 45.43%
- Male Distribution: 54.57%

This gives insights into the churn rate for each group.
- **Key Insight**: Churn rate is higher amongst the Female gender, the bank can tailor retention efforts towards the group.

**Geography Distribution:**
A bar chart displays the number of customers across different regions (France, Spain, Germany),
- France has more customers than Germany and Spain.

This gives insights into the Churn Rate by Geography: this is investigated using a donut chart

- **Key Insight**: Germany has a higher churn rate, it should be targeted with localized retention strategies.

**Age Distribution:**
A histogram shows that the age group 36–50 has the highest customer base.

### 2. Churn Patterns Analysis
**Churn by Age Group:**
A stacked bar chart shows that customers within the age bracket (36–50) have the highest churn but customers within the age bracket (51–65) have a higher churn rate.

**Churn by Credit Score:**
A scatter plot indicates that customers with credit scores below 500 have a much higher churn rate compared to those with scores above 750.
- **Key Insight**: The bank can focus on improving services or offering products to customers with lower credit scores to retain them.

### 3. Banking Behavior & Churn
**Churn by Number of Products:**
A bar chart shows that customers with only 1 product have a much higher churn rate than those with 2 or more products.
- **Key Insight:** Cross-selling more products to customers with fewer products can improve retention.
